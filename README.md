# mordaw
MorDAW is a cross-platform digital audio workstation built using C++ and the JUCE class libraries.

TODO:
- ~~ All processors should be renamed as 'node', this makes more sense considering all processors are connected to the processor graph as nodes. ~~
- Fix bugs relating to the drag and drop functionality in the arrangement.
- Implement UI support for AU and VST plugin formats.
